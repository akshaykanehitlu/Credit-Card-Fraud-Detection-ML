### Credit card fraud detection project using machine learning. Utilizing Kaggle data and Python with Scikit-learn, we apply LOF and Isolation Forest algorithms, aiming for high precision and recall to aid financial institutions and customers in fraud prevention.

### Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning 🕵️‍♂️🔍💳🛡️

Description: This GitHub repository hosts a project dedicated to combating credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue, often eluding detection within a sea of legitimate transactions. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the Kaggle dataset and employ two robust anomaly detection algorithms: Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Isolation Forest.

Our implementation is powered by Python 🐍 and the Scikit-learn library 📊. We kickstart the process by preprocessing the data, tackling duplicates, and handling missing values. Next, we unleash the power of LOF and Isolation Forest to unearth anomalies hidden in the dataset 📈🕵️‍♂️. Performance evaluation is a key component, with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis playing pivotal roles 📉📋.

Our ultimate aim is to craft a highly effective model that excels in both precision and recall when it comes to detecting credit card fraud. By achieving this goal, our project stands to benefit financial institutions and customers alike, providing them with a powerful tool to promptly identify fraudulent transactions and take the necessary actions to prevent further financial losses. Join us in the fight against credit card fraud by exploring this repository and contributing to our mission! 💼🚀💰
